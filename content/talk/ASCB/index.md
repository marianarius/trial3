title: Beyond Cell Lines- Cytoplasmic Membrane Extensions in a Non-model Protist 

abstract: Cell-substrate interactions, motility, and communication through cytoplasmic membrane extensions are of vital interest in many contexts, as diverse as predator-prey interactions in microbial food webs, immune system function in animals, normal embryonic development, and metastatic migration of cancer cells. Studying the regulation of cytoplasmic membrane extension formation will further our understanding of this complex and medically important cellular process. Conventional and divergent cell biology features of protists makes it a perfect model system for understanding higher eukaryotic biology. Here, we introduce a novel and emerging model system, Aurantiochytrium limacinum that possess unique cell biology features that are likely to offer insight into the origin and evolution of eukaryotic cell biology and physiological processes. Particularly, A.  limacinum use an ectoplasmic network (EN) - branched extensions of the plasma membrane - to attach to substrates, gather food, travel, and communicate. The EN is associated with a unique cellular organelle called the bothrosome, and both are formed de novo when motile zoospores settle onto a surface and transition to growth as a vegetative thallus. Microscopic characterization revealed the presence of extensive network of actin filaments in the EN. However, information on the genes/proteins involved in the EN formation and its associated organelle is elusive. Using time resolved confocal microscopy and live-cell imaging of actin polymerization, we visualized the EN formation. Once the A. limacinum zoospores settle, they change their morphology from a small flagellated cell to large round cell which then produce EN within 5 hours. We will explore the use of fluorescent markers for tracking actin filament polymerization during EN formation.
