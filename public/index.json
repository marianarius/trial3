As a result, there is considerable interest in and effort into growing algae for industrial purposes. An economicalmethod to produce a large amount of biomass is the use of the open-raceway pond cultivation platform. However, the nature of the cultivation and the nutrient-rich profile of such cultures attract contaminants such as zooplankton predators, which can result in a sudden culture crash. For effective pond management, an early indicator of grazer presence is needed to implement timely interventions. Currently available tools are offline, time-consuming and dependent on predator concentration. This study explores grazingmediated changes in photosynthetic parameters during infestation of Dunaliella tertiolecta cultures by the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina and the ciliate Euplotes sp. A significant reduction in non-photochemical quenching levels 24–48 h prior to the crashwas observed in both bulk and singlecell prey samples. An increasing rate of grazer ingestion correlated with decreasing non-photochemical quenching levels as the culture progressed towards the crash. The reductions in the non-photochemical quenching levels were consistent in grazing cultures at different prey cell concentrations. Although the maximum photosynthetic yield remained unaltered, maximum relative electron transport rates were enhanced and the light-harvesting efficiency, alpha, reduced in comparison to controls. We suggest that, along with traditionalmethods, non-photochemical quenchingmonitoring could be used as a part of integrative pest management to minimize predator outbreaks.","tags":["Algal stress response"],"title":"Non-photochemical quenching, a non-invasive probe for monitoring microalgal grazing- an early indicator of predation by Oxyrrhis marina and Euplotes sp.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Salinity is one of the significant factors that affect growth and cellular metabolism, including photosynthesis and lipid accumulation, in microalgae and higher plants.

We investigated the effect of salinity on a marine microalga, Microchloropsis gaditana, which is of industrial significance because of its high lipid-accumulating capability. Both short-term (hours) and medium-term (days) effects of salinity were studied across various salinities (38, 55, 70 and 100 PSU). Salinity above 55 PSU supressed cell growth and specific growth rate was significantly reduced at 100 PSU. Photosynthesis (Fv/Fm, rETRmax and Ik) was severely affected at high salinity conditions. Total carbohydrate per cell increased ~1.7 fold after 24 hr, which is consistent with previous findings that salinity induces osmolyte production to counter osmotic shock.

Available genomic tools like high throughput sequencing can create an enriched gene pool which can be used for multiple benefits. However, one of the bottlenecks for any genetic engineering strategy is the availability of appropriate gene expression tools, mainly promoters, to express the genes at the right time, right level, and at the right places,” explains Anbarasu. “And this is where algae helps. Though it has traditionally been used as a biomass source to synthesise molecules, attention has now turned towards using algae to isolate other molecules or using it as a bio-reactor to produce valuable pharmaceuticals and therapeutically important proteins like antibodies, cholera vaccine, etc.”\nAlgae, as a third-generation bio-fuel producer, requires relatively little space compared to its well evolved counterparts (plants). Besides, it can grow in a variety of conditions (including in a saline water body), consuming carbon dioxide much more efficiently than land plants.\nAnbarasu is closely studying the physiological changes that occur in algae during increased saline conditions. “I will be collecting algae samples in different conditions (depending on the interest of regulation points—like growth stages, sunlight intensity, heat, etc.), freezing them, and analysing the mRNA (messenger RNA) and protein levels. This should provide clues to isolate promoters for the genes of interested regulations,” he says.\nThe IITB-Monash Research Academy is a collaboration between India and Australia that endeavours to strengthen scientific relationships between the two countries. Graduate research scholars like Anbarasu study for a dually-badged PhD from both IIT Bombay and Monash University, spending time at both institutions to enrich their research experience.\nSays Prof Murali Sastry, CEO of the Academy, “Anbarasu is attempting to exploit algae to produce valuable compounds at a cheaper cost. This will help bring down prices of many products—especially in the pharmaceutical and therapeutics industry.”\nOnly an ignoramus would take such a study with a pinch of salt!\nThis story was written by Mr Krishna Warrier based on inputs from the research student, his supervisors and IITB-Monash Research Academy.

However, relatively few studies have focussed on the effect of salinity on microalgae and their acclimation strategies. We investigated the effect of salinity on a marine microalga, Nannochloropsis gaditana, which is of industrial significance because of its high lipid-accumulating capability. Both short-term and long-term effects of salinity was studied across various salinities (37.5, 55, 70 and 100 PSU). Salinity above 55 PSU supressed cell growth. The specific growth rate was significantly reduced, and doubling time increased, at 100 PSU. Maximal quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of cells grown at high salt concentrations were lower than for cells grown in normal sea water (37.5 PSU). The photosynthetic parameters were further evaluated by measuring the maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax), light harvesting efficiency alpha and Ik (light saturation point for photosynthesis). rETRmax and  Ik values were severely affected at high salinity conditions, though alpha was only affected in short term responses. However, there was no significant difference in Fv/Fm, rETRmax and Ik values between the cells grown at 37.5 PSU and 55 PSU. This indicates that the cells at 55 PSU could be employing photosynthesis as a potential strategy to overcome salinity. The chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents per cell increased at 100 PSU, suggesting the possible role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching by carotenoids. Further, total carbohydrate per cell increased ~2 fold after 24 hr, which is consistent with previous findings that high salt condition induces osmolyte production to counter osmotic shock. Our findings indicate a possible mechanism of acclimation to salinity, opening up new frontiers for osmolytes in pharmacological and cosmological applications.","tags":null,"title":"Temporal Acclimation of Microchloropsis gaditana CCMP526 in resposne to hyper-osmolarity","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Anbarasu Karthikaichamy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477213200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477213200,"objectID":"c334cca419a368f01efd2a4216ff85ec","permalink":"/talk/abo/","publishdate":"2016-10-23T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/abo/","section":"talk","summary":"Proteomics has become a valuable tool for investigating many aspects of cell and organismal biology.

Microalgal biomass is fermented to bioethanol; while lipids, particularly triacylglycerides (TAGs), are transesterified to biodiesels. Biodiesel has emerged as an ideal biofuel candidate; hence, its commercialization and use are increasingly being emphasized. Abiotic stresses exaggerate TAG accumulation, but the precise mechanisms are yet to be known. More recently, comprehensive multi-omics studies in microalgae have emerged from the biofuel perspective. Genomics and transcriptomics of microalgae have provided crucial leads and basic understanding toward lipid biosynthesis. Proteomics and metabolomics are now complementing “algal omics” and offer precise functional insights into the attendant static and dynamic physiological contexts. Indeed, the field has progressed from shotgun to targeted approaches. Notably, targeted proteomics studies in microalga are not yet reported. Several multi-omics tools and technologies that may be used to dig deeper into the microalgal physiology are examined and highlighted in this review. The article therefore aims to both introduce various available high-throughput biotechnologies and applications of “omics” in microalgae, and enlists a compendium of the emerging cutting edge literature. We suggest that a strategic and thoughtful combination of data streams from different omics platforms can provide a system-wide overview. The algal omics warrants closer attention in the future, with a view to technical, economic, and societal impacts that are anticipated in the current postgenomics era.","tags":["Algal stress response"],"title":"Multi-omics Frontiers in Algal Research- Techniques and Progress to Explore Biofuels in the Postgenomics World","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vigneshwaran Ravishankar","Ahmed Ahmed","Ulaganathan Sivagnanam","Krishnaraja Muthuraman","Anbarasu Karthikaichamy","Herald A Wilson","Ajay Devendran","Rudy A Hartskeerl","Stephen ML Raj"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"7561c0ee0c1310a02b7f98380df61300","permalink":"/publication/resmic/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/resmic/","section":"publication","summary":"We have employed the RNase P RNA (RPR) gene, which is present as single copy in chromosome I of Leptospira spp. to investigate the phylogeny of structural domains present in the RNA subunit of the tRNA processing enzyme, RNase P.

It acts on its target cells through genomic or non-genomic pathway, both involving binding of estrogen to estrogen receptor (ER). Invitro studies using MCF-7 (ER +ve, breast cancer cells) have shown that estrogen independently cannot activate the proliferation of serum starved MCF-7 cells, unless supplemented with certain growth factors like IGF, EGF, etc. Therefore the study attempts to understand the exact role of estrogen in modulating the transcriptional activity of c-Src and mTOR. MCF-7 cells showed increased proliferation rate in mitogenic response to 17β Estradiol (10 nM). To understand the role of non-genomic adaptor proteins in E2 mediated breast cancer proliferation, MCF7 cells were treated with c-Src inhibitor PP1 (10, 100 nM) in the presence and absence of E2. Interestingly, we observed a suppression of cell proliferation in PP1 treated cells whereas addition of E2 increased cell proliferation in a time dependent manner. mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (10nM) alone enhanced cell proliferation whereas in the presence of E2, a suppression in cell growth was observed, coinciding with the 3-H thymidine uptake assay. To understand further, downstream of E2 responsive genes (pS2 and WISP-2) were studied using RT-PCR. GAPDH was used as loading control. Western blot analysis of cell cycle markers such as Cyclin D3, Cyclin E, Cyclin dependent kinases (CDK 2 and 4) and E2F revealed that the inhibition of proliferation is not due to cell cycle arrest. β-actin was used as a loading control. Long term effect on cell proliferation was also studied using colony formation assay. Conclusively all these results show that c-Src is active only when stimulated by liganded estrogen receptor (ER). The same is the case with the rapamycin. These results help to understand insights about c-Src and mTOR and in development of effective drugs against estrogen positive breast cancer.\n","date":1369612800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1369612800,"objectID":"65742f901c0d0c95b0139107de46a5dd","permalink":"/project/breast-cancer/","publishdate":"2013-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/breast-cancer/","section":"project","summary":"Estrogen plays a major role through transcriptional regulation of its target genes. 17β-Estradiol, the predominant circulating estrogen, is known to be a major causative factor in the tumorigenesis of breast cancer.","tags":["Breast cancer"],"title":"Understanding the Molecular Significance of c-Src and mTor in Estrogen Mediated Breast Cancer Proliferation – an Invitro Study","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We have employed the RNase P RNA (RPR) gene, which is present as single copy in chromosome I of Leptospira spp. to investigate the phylogeny of structural domains present in the RNA subunit of the tRNA processing enzyme, RNase P.
